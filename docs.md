## ToolJS 🛠⚙
This is an open-source collection of functions, methods and routine javascript operations which every front-end developer might have a use for at some point in their project.

It is worth saying that this is a dependency free library, and was built from ground up using plain old vanilla javascript.

It bascially simplifies your work flow by shorthanding some of the long boring codes you write everytime which may consist of so many functions, variables, methods and so on, into a single function. From DOM manipulation, to mathematical calculations to string manipulations and so on all in one library(Pretty useful uh!😎).

Think of it as Lodash and JQuery all in one, with a few more tricks and flicks off it's sleaves.

Why write or copy the same code over and over again when you could just have it all in one library for easy access (Well step right up ToolJS 👏).
