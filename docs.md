## ToolJS 🛠⚙
This is an open-source collection of functions, methods and routine javascript operations which every front-end developer might have a use for at some point in their project.

It bascially simplifies your work flow by shorthanding some of the long boring codes you write everytime which may consist of so many functions, variables, methods and so on, into a single function. From DOM manipulation, to mathematical calculations to string manipulations and so on all in one library(Pretty useful uh!😎).

Why write or copy the same code over and over again when you could just have it all in one library for easy access (Well step right up ToolJS 👏).
